<p>Dear ${name},</p>

<p>${energyAdvocate} has been chosen as this week’s Electricity Savings Advocate for your floor! As your Electricity Savings Advocate, ${energyAdvocate} will advise you on ways to reduce electricity usage and may coordinate activities to make sure we see a reduction in electricity consumption.</p>

<p>Do your part to make sure that your floor wins this week! ${energyAdvocate} will remind you to switch off  your computer, printer, and aircon/ heater at the end of the day, but show us that you don’t need the reminders by doing it consistently! ${energyAdvocate} will also coordinate the floor so that the last person to leave for the day (or the weekend) switches off all communal lights, office equipment and kitchen appliances.</p> 

<p>Remember, while ${energyAdvocate} is the Electricity Savings Advocate for this week, using electricity efficiently is everybody’s responsibility! Let us make saving electricity BETTER TOGETHER</p>
