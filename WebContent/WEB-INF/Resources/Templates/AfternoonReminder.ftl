<p>Dear ${name},</p>

<p>Please remember to switch off your desktop computer, laptop and office printer before heading out for the weekend.</p> 

<p>Before going home, check whether you are the last to leave the ${floor} floor. If so, be sure to turn off (at the wall) all communal office equipment and kitchen appliances like the printer, kettle, toaster, microwave and water heater. And remember to switch off the lights on your way out!</p> 

<p>Thanks for helping us to meet our target of reducing electricity usage by 10% across all Provincial Buildings by 2015. Let us make using electricity efficiently BETTER TOGETHER!</p>

<p>Have a great weekend!</p>
