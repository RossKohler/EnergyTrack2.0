<p>Dear ${name},</p>

<p>As we indicated to you at the start of Phase 1 of the 2Wise2Waste Electricity Savings Project, the Western Cape Government has committed to reducing the electricity usage in Provincial Buildings by 10% by 2015. We have a follow-up plan for Phase 2 of this project and will be working together with you to achieve this goal.</p>

<p>As you know, we have installed electricity meters in 4 Dorp Street that will track how much electricity each floor uses. But you and your colleagues are the only ones who can make those meters’ readings go down.</p>

<p>We need you to join the Electricity Savings Competition that begins next week. Don’t worry, we’ll send tips and support you in every effort, and you can always email us back if you have any questions. Also every week, we’ll announce the floor that has done the best to reduce its electricity use.</p> 

<p>Your floor may be the winner showcased in e-mails and on the new lobby monitors. We’re excited to see what strategies each floor comes up with in order to win. Good luck!</p> 

<p>We can make the Government a greener place BETTER TOGETHER!</p>
