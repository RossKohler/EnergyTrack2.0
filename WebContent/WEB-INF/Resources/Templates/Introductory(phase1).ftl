<p>Dear ${name},</p>

<p>The Western Cape Government has committed to reducing the electricity usage in Provincial Buildings by 10% by 2015. We have a plan for working together to achieve this goal, and we need your help.</p>  

<p>We have installed new electricity meters in 4 Dorp Street that will track how much electricity each floor uses. But you and your colleagues are the only ones who can make those meters’ readings go down.</p> 

<p>We need you to join the Electricity Savings Project that begins next week. Here’s how it works. All employees should aim to reduce their electricity usage. We’ll send tips and support you in every effort! Information about the building’s electricity consumption will be displayed live on screens in the foyer</p>

<p>Thanks for your efforts and good luck!</p> 

<p>We can make the Government a greener place BETTER TOGETHER!</p>
